# spectrogram-inpainting
A repository and webpage accompanying the paper *Janssen 2.0: Audio Inpainting in the Time-frequency Domain*.

> The paper focuses on inpainting missing parts of an audio signal spectrogram. First, a recent successful approach based on an untrained neural network is revised and its several modifications are proposed, improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the restored audio. Second, the Janssen algorithm, the autoregression-based state-of-the-art for time-domain audio inpainting, is adapted for the time-frequency setting. This novel method, coined Janssen-TF, is compared to the neural network approach using both objective metrics and a subjective listening test, proving Janssen-TF to be superior in all the considered measures.
